# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This is the first project out of five that I completed as part of the 'Data Analysis with Python' course from freeCodeCamp. For this project, I worked on Replit using their test code to develop a function. The function converts a 9 digits list into a 3x3 Numpy array and then return the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min and sum of the rows, columns and elements inside the matrix.
